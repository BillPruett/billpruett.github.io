               <p>
                After I first stroked the strings of a guitar from my dad when I was 14,  I could never put it down. Music is not just a passion for me, it is life.   
                </p>
                
                <p>My love of music sprang out like it did for many other teenagers in the 90s, and rock music stroked my soul. I have soaked in much of the Raleigh night scene, performing the sounds of rock and blues through original music and old time favorites. </p>
                
                <p> My musical style expanded when I attended the NC School of the Arts and East Carolina University to study classical guitar. Another great experience was learning more about jazz and receiving a Bachelor of Music degree from NC Central University, where I was privileged to learn from some of the most talented musicians in the world. </p>
                
                <p>To me, there is no limit to the genres of music, be it classical, rock, jazz, blues, gypsy, flamenco, I totally immerse myself into the sound of music and indulge the joy, energy, comfort, and relaxation it brings to me and my audience. I invite you to join me on the journey of music and explore the possibilities!
